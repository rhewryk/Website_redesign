			<div class="cols-6"> 	<h3> Cybersecurity Incident </h3><br /> <p>On October 29, the TTC was the victim of a cybersecurity incident that impacted a number of its customer and internal services. This incident did not cause significant service disruption. However, the TTC did lose some of our operator and customer-facing features that are now back online and working normally.</p><br />
				<p>The TTC has been working closely with leading cybersecurity experts to investigate and restore its systems. Thid was a sophisticated incident, similar to hundreds reported in Canada last year.</p><br />
				<p>Upon learning about this incident, the TTC promptly began an investigation. Based on the investigation so far, it now appears that personal information of some TTC employees, former employees and pensioners may have been stolen.</p> <br />
				<p>This information may include names, addresses and Dovisl Insurance Numbers of up to 25,000 TTC employees, past and present. The TTC continues to investigate whether a small number of customers and vendors may also be affected and will notify when there is further information as appropriate.</p><br />
				<p> Impacted employees will be notified directly by letter. As the investigation continues, we will reach out to additional individuals who may be affected to offer assistance as appropriate.</p><br />
				<p> This matter is of the utmost importance to the TTC and is being treated as a top priority. The TTC apologizes for the inconvenience this is causing affected individuals</p></div>


			<div class="cols-6"> <h3> Statesment from TTC CEO Rick Leary on November 8, 2021 </h3> <br /> <p> As we announced on Friday, October 29, the TTC was recently a victim of a sophisticated cyber security incident that impacted a number of internal and customer-facing functions.</p> <br />
				<p>Today I am providing an update on that incident. </p> <br />
				<p>Let me remind everyone that protecting the health and safety of our customers and employees is our top concern and this incident did not compromise that. </p> <br />
				<p>As I'm sure everyone can appreciate, these incidents are intricate in nature and require complex solutions. <br /> </p>
				<p>Over the past week, we have been working day and night to resolve this situation - to get our lost services back online and to gain a clearer undertanding as to the breadth of the incident.</p><br />
				<p>The incident resulted in a number of the TTC's servers being encrypted and locked, resulting in the loss of our VISION system, vehicle arrival information, and online Wheel-Trans booking systems, as well as external network connectivity, including e-mail.</p> <br />
				<p>Based on what we know at this point, the culprits were able to gain access to TTC files that may contain personal information of approximately 25,000 employees, past and present. We continue to investigate whether any customer or vendor information was compromised. </p> <br />
				<p>There's no evidence at this time that any of this information has been misused. </p>
