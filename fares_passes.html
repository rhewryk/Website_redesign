		<h3>Proof of age</h3><br />
		<p>The TTC Child Proof-of-Age Card is available for children who are tall for their age. The card lets TTC drivers and collectors verify that the child is 12 or younger and eligible for to ride for free. Every September, we send a quantity of these cards to every elementary and secondary school in Toronto that has 11 and 12 year olds.</p><br />
		<p>To obtain one of these Proof-of-Age Cards at your school, please ask your school administration. In addition to their availability at schools, you can get a Child Proof-of-Age Card by calling TTC Customer Service at (416) 393-4636.</p><br /><br />
		<p>Youth ages 13 to 15 are not required to carry identification when travelling on the TTC.</p><br />
		<p>For the 2021-2022 school year, youths ages 16 to 19 will be required to carry the following forms of photo identification as proof of age when travelling on the TTC:</p><br />
			<p>	-High school photo identification for the 2020-2021, if applicable, or 2019-2020 school year</p><br />
			<p>	-Driver's License or Ontario Photo Card</p><br />
		<p>This temporary change is being made as a result of COVID-19 and the fact that some schools may not be allowing photographers in the school to take pictures of the students.</p><br />
		<p>If you are a senior 65 years of age or over, you will need to carry appropriate identification and present it to TTC staff upon request. You can use a government-issued photo ID, such as a Driver's License or the Ontario PhotoCard.</p><br />
